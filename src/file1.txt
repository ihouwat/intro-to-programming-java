List is a raw type. However, List<?> is a unbounded wildcard parameterized type. 
Because List is a parameterized interface, you should always specify its type argument. 
In this example, the List formal argument is specified with a unbounded wildcard (?) as its formal type parameter, 
which means that the countElements method can accept any instantiation of the List interface.
